# Magic-The-Gathering-University-Project
MTG combat text simulator (Bit buggy and all over the place).
This was a two week group project written by my colleagues, Umniyah Sameer Haitham Abbood and Şükran Öykü Erdik, and myself.
The project is admittedly buggy and clunky. However, it was assigned to us during the finals which is why it was a bit rushed.
